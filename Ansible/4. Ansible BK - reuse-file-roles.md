### Re-using files and roles

```

```

Ansible offers two ways to re-use files and roles in a playbook: dynamic and static.

For **dynamic re-use**, add an include_* task in the tasks section of a play:

include_role

include_tasks

include_vars

For **static re-use** , add an import_* task in the tasks section of a play:

import_role

import_tasks


### Includes: dynamic re-use
Including roles, tasks, or variables adds them to a playbook dynamically. Ansible processes included files and roles as they come up in a playbook, 
so included tasks can be affected by the results of earlier tasks within the top-level playbook. Included roles and tasks are similar to handlers -
they may or may not run, depending on the results of other tasks in the top-level playbook.


### Imports: static re-use
Importing roles, tasks, or playbooks adds them to a playbook statically. Ansible pre-processes imported files and roles before it runs any tasks in a playbook, 
so imported content is never affected by other tasks within the top-level playbook.

The filenames for imported roles and tasks support templating, but the variables must be available when Ansible is pre-processing the imports. 
This can be done with the vars keyword or by using --extra-vars.
